## Technical Projects

**[Weather Data Pipeline](https://daxaurora.github.io/weather-data-pipeline)**  
Designed and built an automated, containerized data solution with a microservices architecture using Docker, Python, and SQL for loading NOAA weather data into PostgreSQL. Ongoing project to be built out for use on AWS incorporating a CI/CD workflow.

**[Predicting Solar Panel Adoption](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/projects/2019/predicting-solar-panel-adoption)**  
Developed Python random forest model with hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering to improve predictions of US residential solar panel adoption, scaled to distributed architecture using Spark, and piped to Tableau via SQL as a geospatial tool.

**[River Sediment Data Analysis](https://daxaurora.github.io/River_Sediment_Data_Analysis/)**  
From river sediment data collected by the US Forest Service, created data visualizations and performed statistical analysis using Python pandas, matplotlib, and Jupyter.

**[Streaming Twitter Sentiment Analyzer](https://daxaurora.github.io/MIDS_W251_YetAnotherTwitterSentimentAnalyzer_YATSA/)**  
Designed and deployed machine learning pipeline for real-time Twitter sentiment analysis, using Linux, IBM Cloud, Kafka, Spark Streaming, Cassandra, StanfordCoreNLP and Tableau.

**[Gradient Descent Applied to Logistic Regression in Spark](https://daxaurora.github.io/MIDS_W261_FinalProject_Summary/)**   
Built and deployed MapReduce logistic regression algorithm with gradient descent at scale on distributed cloud infrastructure to predict online ad click-through rate. Algorithm and feature engineering written using Spark and PySpark in Jupyter Notebook, deployed to cloud using Google DataProc.

**[Big Data Architecture: Exploring Solar Energy Production](https://daxaurora.github.io/w205_energy/)**   
Built ETL pipeline to explore weather impact on solar energy production using AWS, PostgreSQL, Linux, and Python packages psycopg2, pandas, and sklearn.

## Writing and Presentations

**[Spatial Data Modeling: Night Skies Visibility](https://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/proc15/papers/839_474.pdf)**  
Co-authored Night Skies Visibility Modeling with Grand Canyon's GIS Program Manager, Mark Nebel. Accepted for presentation at 2015 ESRI User Conference.

**[Night Skies Protection and Data Assessments](https://www.grandcanyon.org/media/2172/document_learn_fieldinstitute_gts_2015_williams_presentation.pdf)**<br/> Created and presented a summary of Grand Canyon's Night Skies Protection program for the Grand Canyon Field Institute's 2015 annual Hiking Guides Training Seminar.

**[Data Ethics and Privacy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1724spDc_VEaI_tIH-Peo-mSBkjjpnhcUlYWyrX4Y5FA/edit?usp=sharing)**  
White paper titled *Gender and Sexual Assault: What Can Data “Know?”* explores multiple interpretations emerging from seemingly simple crime statistics, in the spirit of Sandra Harding's concept that "All scientific knowledge is always, in every respect, socially situated." (from *Whose Science? Whose Knowledge? Thinking from Women’s Lives*)
